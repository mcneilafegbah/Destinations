# DESTINATION
Welcome,

Destination is aimed at  providing people who are thinking of visiting istanbul Turker, Paris France, Cancun Mexico or Santorini Greece Cork  some information on each city and to help them decide which city they may prefer to visit.

Each city page has the same structure so users will be familiar with the layout if they are browsing all 4 cities. Each page gives a brief overview of the cities , a google map with a drop down menu providing some recommendations for categories of Hotels, Bars, Restaurants and Tourist Attractions. 

ADDITIONAL FEATURES

I also wanted users to the site to be able to price and book flights. View and book accommodation, restaurants, and tourist attractions. Some additional features i also added were:

A Skyscanner widget that is already preset to the nearest airport of each city. Users only need to enter their airport of origin and the dates they wish to travel and Skyscanner will provide them with a list of available flights. .
Finally at the bottom of each page i have added a contact form that which i have not configured yet.

## 1. User Experience (UX)


### 1.1 - Target Audience
This website is aimed at anyone who is thinking of, or who has already organized a trip to visit the Cancun, Paris, Istanbul or Santorini.

### 1.2 - Visitor goals
Visitor to the city should be able to find out a few different things.

How they can get to the cities from overseas, they would need 
 flight information.
They will need to see options for hotels, restaurants, bars, and tourist attractions.
Potential visitors might not have been to the city before they would also like some recommendations from the people who run the website as they would have an idea of the things a visitor should see.

Finally they would  want to be able to contact the people who run the website just incase they have any questions if needed.

### 1.3 - User Stories
As a visitor looking wanting to travel to any of this cities,

* A simple user friendly site where i can get a brief overview of the city i plan to visit. 
* I want the information laid out as simple as possible to navigate.
* I want the site to provide me with the contact details such as: phone number, address, email, website, and a google map location for things that they are recommending that i should see/do when im in the city.
* I  most likely will be viewing the site from a mobile phone or tablet. I want the site to have been designed  for mobile view (responsive)
* I also expect to be able to connect to the sites social media channels with a simple click so i can keep up to date with anything that the site admins may post there.

### User Experience Walk through
This user lands on the Destination homepage. They are thinking of doing a short weekend in one of this cities with their family . On the landing page they have 4 options to choose from. They click which every city the wish to.

![Image Description](/assets/images/destination1.PNG)

When any of the page opens the user can clearly see the Navbar at the top of the page that immediately tells them they can visit other city pages

![Image Description](/assets/images/destination2.PNG)


The user can scroll down to seea short history of the city 


The user can also see that the closest airport to the city has already been pre-populated for them, so they only need to enter their airport of origin and the dates they are looking to travel. 

The Skyscanner widget will automatically help with a list of airport to choose from as the they start typing

After the user presses search flights, they are taking  to the skyscanner page on a new tab where they can adjust the filter's they i need to price and book flights. 

![Image Description](/assets/images/destination4.PNG)

The user can scroll down and see the Google Map of Dublintheir destination being displayed. This again is something the user is very familiar with as Google maps are pretty much the standard on most websites. The user clicks on the dropdown option and selects any of the 4 options (Hotels, Bar, Restaurants, Tourist attraction)

![Image Description](/assets/images/destination5.PNG)

They get a marker that drops on the page and when they click on it it gives them a bried descripition and a link to their website or web page which opens in another tab for more information



At the bottom of the page the user sees that there is a contact form they can use to message the site admin. A handy little tool, for now though the user has a good mix of information that they can go back to show their friends so they can decide what they will be booking in terms of flights and accommodation.

### 1.4 Design Choices

My plan was to make the website Authestically pleasing. My plan was to add more images in the project but was out of time and couldnt do this. WIll definately do it once submitted. Also added the flight widget and map to make a look cool.

### FONT
* For the website i decided to use the google font style of Montserrat. It can be used to set body texts and works well in titles and headlines too. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text_type=custom&query=montserrat">Font</a>

### Wire Frames
* <a href= "/assets/images/Home Screen Desktop.png" target="_blank">Homepage Desktop</a>
* <a href= "/assets/images/homepage Ipad  Vertical.png" target="_blank">Homepage iPad Vertical</a>
* <a href= "/assets/images/homepage Ipad Horizontal.png" target="_blank">Homepage iPad Horizontal</a>

* <a href= "/assets/images/Destination Mobile.png" target="_blank">Destination mobile phone</a>




## 2.1 - The NAvbar
For the Navbar i used Html and javascript. I chose this option because i wanted the Navbar to be responsive on all screen sizes.

![Image Description](/assets/images/destination11.PNG)<br>

On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar items.

## 2.2 - SkyScanner JavaScript Widget

I  also installed a Skyscanner widget on the website. This will allow users of the site to enter the city they are flying from, the dates they are looking to fly, and when the click on search flights Skyscanner will give them flight availability and prices. As the site isn't an integrated partner booking a flight on the site isn't possible, instead the user is diverted to the Skyscanner page.

## 2.3 Google Maps 

I added Google Map to each city page. Users can click on the dropdown menu and select which category they are looking for recommendations for and the map will generate a list of markers to provide this information to the user.

To activate the functionality for the Google map  generated an API key on the Google maps dashboard. Google maps allows for a certain number of free API calls per month and once you go beyond this limit you will be billed.

To secure my API key from being copied and used by other people i have restricted its use in my Google maps dashboard. The Google maps API will now only publish the map on the urls that i have authorized. The deployed Github url in my repository is the authorized link a user must use for the site to function correctly.

## 2.4 Google Maps

At the bottom of every page i have placed a contact us form where users can send emails direct us but his functions isnt working yet

## 2.4 Footer

## 3. Technologies/Languages Used


The footer is identical on each page to maintain consistency no matter what page the user finds themselves on.
