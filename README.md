# DESTINATION
Welcome,

Destination is aimed at  providing people who are thinking of visiting istanbul Turker, Paris France, Cancun Mexico or Santorini Greece Cork  some information on each city and to help them decide which city they may prefer to visit.

Each city page has the same structure so users will be familiar with the layout if they are browsing all 4 cities. Each page gives a brief overview of the cities , a google map with a drop down menu providing some recommendations for categories of Hotels, Bars, Restaurants and Tourist Attractions. 

ADDITIONAL FEATURES

I also wanted users to the site to be able to price and book flights. View and book accommodation, restaurants, and tourist attractions. Some additional features i also added were:

A Skyscanner widget that is already preset to the nearest airport of each city. Users only need to enter their airport of origin and the dates they wish to travel and Skyscanner will provide them with a list of available flights. .
Finally at the bottom of each page i have added a contact form that is powered by Email JS. When a user submits a message to the site i as the site owner will receive an email notification. The user will also receive an automated email reply confirming there message has been received and that we will be contacting them shortly to answer their enquiry.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
